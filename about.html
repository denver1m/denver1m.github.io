    <h1>Denver Harrie Beratio</h1>
    <p>
   My name is Denver Harrie Beratio, an 18‑year‑old Criminology student at the University of the Cordilleras. I am dedicated to the principles of law enforcement, justice, and community service—values that guide my academic path and fuel my ambition to serve as an ethical and impactful law enforcement officer.
</p>
<p>
In senior high school, I held a leadership role on the Supreme Student Council, where I honed vital communication, teamwork, and responsibility skills. As a varsity basketball player, I earned the title of 2024 Athlete of the Year, recognizing my dedication and performance in sport. I also proudly secured 1st Runner‑Up at the Pianagyaman Festival, showcasing my competitive spirit and community involvement.
</p>
<p>
Building further on my athletic accomplishments, I emerged as Champion in the Apps Division 3×3 Basketball (Secondary Level)—a testament to my teamwork, discipline, and strategic thinking on the court.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and riding motorcycles—activities that enhance my focus, mental strength, and balance. These passions reinforce the determination and resilience I carry into academics and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Currently pursuing a degree in Criminology at the University of the Cordilleras, I am committed to learning and growing in preparation for a meaningful career in public safety. Grounded by integrity, fueled by purpose, and driven by perseverance, I aim to contribute positively to justice and community well-being in every chapter of my journey.
